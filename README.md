# random-bookmarklets
just random i have no idea why ima leave this public

## scripts
- bootloader.js
    it puts you on the google page used for storing the manager.js data and runs it
- manager.js
    removes the original sites elements and loads new ones

## files
- manger.style.css
    just the manager.js's actual formating its just so it can be easily edited without editing a giant unreadable not formated string
