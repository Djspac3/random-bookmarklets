# bookmarklets
just some bookmarks i have/am making

**note:**use the ones in the finished/ directory (why: im not adding releases and want it to be easy to share with my self)

## building
```npm run build```
that will output the bookmarklet automaticly in dist
the javascript: prefix is not automaticly included for testing reasons

## scripts
- bootloader.js
    it puts you on the google page used for storing the manager.js data and runs it
- manager.js
    removes the original sites elements and loads new ones

## files
- manger.style.css
    just the manager.js's actual formating its just so it can be easily edited a giant unreadable string
    **this has to manualy be minified and copyed**
    why: im too lazy/unknowledgeable to make a script for it
