# bookmarklets
just some bookmarks i have/am making

**note:**use the ones in the finished/ directory (why: im not adding releases and want it to be easy to share with my self)

## building
```npm run build```
that will output the bookmarklet automaticly in dist  
the javascript: prefix is not automaticly included for testing reasons

## files
- dist/manager.js
the manager script for storing loads of scripts
  
- dist/tools.js
a set of a few random tools you might enjoy/need
  
- tests/spec.js
a playwright test for each script (requires compiled files rn)


## files
- manger.style.css
    just the manager.js's actual formating its just so it can be easily edited a giant unreadable string
    **this has to manualy be minified and copyed**  
    why: im too lazy/unknowledgeable to make a script for it
